# Instructions
The MIDI data for each device is saved in [yaml](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) files. 

The yaml files are organized in folders `data > brands`

Each yaml file follows a template (see template below)

After a new yaml file is created, the `mapping.json` file needs to be updated to map the brand and product name to the new file.
