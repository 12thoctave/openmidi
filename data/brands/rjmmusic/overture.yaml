    The MIDI channel can be set by entering setup mode.

    To enter setup mode, hold the ON/OFF button as you power up the pedal. The mode LEDs will spin for 3 seconds.
    Keep holding until the LEDs stop spinning and all light up in green. Once in setup mode, you can use the MODE
    button to select a MIDI channel.

    The current MIDI channel is indicated by the four preset LEDs using the following code:

    The Overture responds to standard MIDI program changes on its speciﬁed MIDI channel. Please refer to the Setup 
    Mode section for details on how to set the MIDI channel. PC numbers 0 through 99 are accepted, for a total of 100 
    presets. Receiving PC#127 will cause the Overture to bypass itself. After bypassing the Overture using this 
    method, the next PC message received (in the range of 0-99) will re-activate the pedal.

    Please note that PC numbers are one lower than preset numbers on the Overture. For example, send PC#0 to 
    recall the ﬁrst preset, send PC#1 to recall the second preset, etc.
