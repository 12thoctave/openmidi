    Enter the Boot Menu by pressing and holding the PROGRAM (left) footswitch before powering on the pedal;
    continue to hold down the footswitch until after the firmware version number and the instrument mode have both been displayed.
    Turn the PARAMETER dial to “Note Off Level” to see the name of the menu parameter.
    Step through the parameters by pressing the left footswitch again until you get to "GLb".
    Turn PARAMETER dial clockwise to any other position to see the parameter’s value. Adjust the value by turning the EDIT dial.
    Choose channel 1-16 or "ALL" for omni mode. When editing is complete, turn the FI off and on again.

  - description: 'Default value: 127 (0 in SYNTH Mode). Modulation (CC1) is routed
      to both VCF and VCO LFO Modulation. The depth set in the program will be reached
      if CC1 is at maximum (127). Practically, the modulation value(s) in the program
      will be multiplied with the MIDI controller value 127. Beware: if you use the
      FI with a keyboard and set the Mod Wheel to minimum, CC1 will be at zero. If,
      at this point. you disconnect the MIDI keyboard and instead play the FI with
      your instrument via the audio input, you will find that there is no LFO modulation
      in the programs where you would expect it; this is because CC1 is still at zero.
      You will need to reset CC1 to its default value of 127 by changing program,
      adjusting a flexi slot in the Editor or powering the FI off and on again.'
