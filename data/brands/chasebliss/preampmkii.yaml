    Preamp MKII™ is set to MIDI channel 2 by default. This can be changed by holding down both stomp switches simultaneously when
    you provide power to the pedal and releasing the stomp switches once the seven segment display on the front of the pedal lights up.
    The pedal is now looking for the first Program Change message it sees and will set itself to whichever channel it receives that message from.
    This is saved as the new MIDI channel until you decide to change it again.

    RECALLING A PRESET VIA MIDI

    Presets 0-29 are recalled using Program Changes 0-29. You can do this by sending the corresponding Program Change message
    from your MIDI controller. For example, sending a Program Change message of “4” loads bank one (left LED off), preset four.
    Sending a message of “17” loads bank two (left LED red), preset seven. Sending a program change of “20” loads bank three (left LED green), preset zero.

    SAVING A PRESET

    Once you get the tone you want, hold down the Bypass foot switch
    and your settings will be saved to the current preset slot.
