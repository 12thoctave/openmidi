- name: Wow
  value: '14'
  description: |-
    This control refers to the lower frequency pitch fluctuation that can affect audio played back on tape machines. Turning the control clockwise will increase
    the depth and speed of the random pitch fluctuations
    allowing for random vibrato and chorus sounds.

- name: Wet
  value: '15'
  description: 'When there are no dip switches assigned to ramp any controls, this
    knob controls the level of the wet signal. The volume of the wet signal increases
    as the user turns the knob clockwise. This is useful to make up for signal loss
    due to use of the filters. If a dip switch is engaged for ramping, you can set
    this knob to control any of the five parameters individually or simultaneously
    (Wow, Flutter, Gen, LP, HP), and have it either modulate (Bounce) or ramp-and-hold
    (rise or fall) via dip switches in the back of the pedal. In this case, this knob
    controls the ramp time in which this takes place. '

- name: HP
  value: '16'
  description: Sets the cutoff frequency for a resonant high-pass filter. Turn clockwise
    to sweep from no hi pass filtering, to heavy filtering. This has a “brightening”
    effect on the audio.

- name: Flutter
  value: '17'
  description: While WOW describes the slow gentle pitch fluctuations, Flutter refers
    to the relatively fast, random pitch fluctuations that are in large part responsible
    for “that” tape sound. Instead of sounding like vibrato, flutter causes more of
    a timbral change to the incoming audio.

- name: Gen
  value: '18'
  description: Gen controls the sample rate of the wet signal. At its max, the audio
    quality is as pristine as it gets, but as you turn the knob counterclockwise,
    the audio becomes increasingly lower quality. While not truly an aspect of analog
    tape degradation, this control is useful to have in any lo-fi effect.

- name: LP
  value: '19'
  description: Sets the cutoff frequency for a resonant low pass filter. The sweep
    is the opposite of the high pass filter, in that more of the audio is filtered
    as you turn the knob counter clockwise. Used in conjunction with the HP knob,
    the user can really narrow in on the high and low frequency signal attenuation
    to get that tape sound.

- name: AUX FUNC Select
  value: '21'
  description: This toggle selects the function applied to the signal when the AUX
    stomp is pressed. When the toggle is set to the MOD setting, both the WOW and
    FLUTTER controls will be maxed out when the footswitch is activated. Setting the
    toggle to GEN will allow the user to change between the max Gen setting and the
    knob defined Gen setting each time the footswitch is activated. Finally, the AUX
    stomp can be used to bypass the filters by setting the AUX FUNC toggle to FILTER.
    Sending value 1 selects the left toggle position(MOD). Sending value 2 selects
    the middle toggle position(Gen). Sending value 3 selects the right toggle position(Filter).

- name: DRY Select
  value: '22'
  description: This toggle selects the amount of dry signal that is mixed in with
    the wet signal. The user can select from NONE, SMALL, or UNITY. When set to SMALL,
    a little bit of the dry signal will be mixed in. There is a trim pot that allows
    the user to select how present the dry signal will be. When set to UNITY, the
    dry signal will be set to the same level as your bypassed tone. This can also
    be adjusted via internal trimmer.Sending value 1 selects the left toggle position(None).
    Sending value 2 selects the middle toggle position(Small). Sending value 3 selects
    the right toggle position(Unity).

- name: HISS Select
  value: '23'
  description: Selects between three levels of noise, from none, to quite a bit. These
    noise generators are a mixture of white noise and flutter distortion and can be
    sculpted with the high pass and low pass filters.Sending value 1 selects the left
    toggle position(None). Sending value 2 selects the middle toggle position(Mild).
    Sending value 3 selects the right toggle position(Heavy).

- name: Expression
  value: '100'
  description: The Wow, HP, Flutter, Gen, and LP dip switches in the left bank allow
    you to control parameters via Expression Pedal / CV. If you have something plugged
    into the EXP / CV jack but do not have any parameters selected via dip switch,
    you can control the Wet knob via expression or CV. It behaves like it has “rise”
    and “bottom” sweep dip switches engaged. The range of the expression / CV is controlled
    by the parameter knob position and the “Sweep” dip switch. For example, if you
    wanted an expression pedal to control the WOW parameter from the least possible
    to halfway, you would make sure the “Sweep” dip switch is in the bottom position
    and set the WOW knob around noon. If you need more WOW, you simply turn the WOW
    knob clockwise. This will increase the maximum range of the expression pedal.
    This allows you to control multiple parameters with an expression pedal, but you
    can fine tune the range that you want for each parameter. Sending a value 0 would
    be equivalent to an expression pedal being completely “off”, while sending 127
    is equivalent to a fully depressed expression pedal. All numbers in between correspond
    to knob positions in between those extremes. As always, the dip switches on the
    pedal select which parameter(s) are being controlled via expression.

- name: AUX FUNC
  value: '101'
  description: Activates the auxiliary function defined by the AUX FUNC toggle. This
    stomp can also be set to latching or momentary active via a dip switch on the
    back. Sending value 127 engages AUX FUNC. Sending value 0 bypasses.

- name: Both Stomps
  value: '103'
  description: Sending value 127 engages pedal and AUX FUNC. Sending value 85 engages
    AUX FUNC, and bypasses pedal. Sending value 45 engages pedal and bypasses AUX
    FUNC. Sending value 0 bypasses both.
