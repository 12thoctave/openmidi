    CXM 1978TM is set to MIDI channel 2 by default. This can be changed by holding down both stomp switches simultaneously when you provide power to the 
    pedal and releasing the stomp switches once the	seven segment display on the front of the pedal lights up. The pedal is now looking for the first 
    program change message it sees and will set itself to whichever channel it receives that message from. Note that you may need to send that program change 
    message more than one time. This is saved as the new MIDI channel until you decide to change it again.

   SAVING A PRESET VIA MIDI

   You can save your current settings via MIDI to any of the 30 preset slots. Send CC#27 and the value (0-29) will save the current configuration to the 
   intended preset slot. Remember, you can also save a preset to the current slot at any time by pressing and holding the SAVE stomp switch on the pedal.

   RECALLING A PRESET VIA MIDI

   Presets 0-29 are recalled using Program Changes 0-29. You can do this by sending the corresponding Program Change message
   from your MIDI controller. For example, sending a Program Change message of “4” loads bank one (left LED off), preset four.
   Sending a message of “17” loads bank two (left LED red), preset seven. Sending a program change of “20” loads bank three (left LED green), preset zero.
