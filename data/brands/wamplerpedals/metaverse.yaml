  - name: Delay Time (high ms)

    description: |-
      A Time High message followed by a Time Low message
      will set the delay time to a specific ms value. It is possi-
      ble to set very specific delay times (with 1ms resolution)
      using two sequential MIDI commands.
      First, send CC 14 with the high byte (calculated below)
      Second, send CC 15 with the low byte (calculated
      below)

  - name: Delay Time (low ms)
    value: '15'
    description: |-
      Each message is a 7-bit value, and sent together will
      be interpreted as a 14-bit value. To set a specific delay
      time in milliseconds using MIDI CC 14 and 15:
      1. Determine high byte: take delay time in
      milliseconds and divide by 128. The number left of
      the decimal is the high byte. (eg. 400ms delay time ->
      400/128 = 3.125 -> high byte = 3
      2. Determine low byte: multiply the number right of
      the decimal by 128. This is the low byte.
      (eg. 400ms delay time -> 400/128 = 3.125 -> 0.125 ->
      0.125 * 128 = 16 -> low byte = 16
      3. Send MIDI CC 14 val=highbyte (3) first, and then
      MIDI CC 15 val=lowbyte (16) second.
      4. After receiving both bytes, the device will update
      the delay time to match the received messages.
