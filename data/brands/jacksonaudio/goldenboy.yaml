    By default, the GOLDEN BOY ships with MIDI Channel 1 being the selected channel. 
    This can be changed by pressing and holding the DRIVE footswitch while applying power to the GOLDEN BOY. 
    Press the BOOST footswitch to increment the MIDI channel number.

    You’ll notice that as you continue to hold the DRIVE footswitch, the BOOST LED will flash to indicate which MIDI channel you have selected. 
    IE – 7 flashes = MIDI Channel 7. After the LED flashes, we inserted a 2-second pause so you could tell when the LED was finished flashing. 
    The LED will continue flashing as long as you are holding down the DRIVE footswitch. 
    Once you have selected the MIDI channel you want and have verified it by counting the flashes, simply release the DRIVE footswitch and the pedal will save this MIDI Channel to the internal EEPROM on the microprocessor and reboo
