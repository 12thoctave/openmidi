    By default, the ASABI ships with MIDI Channel 1 being the selected channel. This
    can be changed by pressing and holding the DIST footswitch while applying power
    to the ASABI. Press the DRIVE footswitch to increment the MIDI channel number. 
    You’ll notice that as you continue to hold the DIST footswitch, the DRIVE LED will
    flash to indicate which MIDI channel you have selected. IE – 7 flashes = MIDI
    Channel 7. After the LED flashes, we inserted a 2-second pause so you could tell
    when the LED was finished flashing. The LED will continue flashing as long as you
    are holding down the DIST footswitch. Once you have selected the MIDI channel
    you want and have verified it by counting the flashes, simply release the DIST
    footswitch and the pedal will save this MIDI Channel to the internal EEPROM on
    the microprocessor and reboot.
